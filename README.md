# Cicada Zombies: classification of cicadas affected with Massospora Cicadina using image data

This spring, two broods of periodical cicadas (among seven) will emerge in parts of the South and the Midwest singing their love songs. The co-emergence of these two broods has not happened since Thomas Jefferson was president. Like many animals, they, too, are susceptible to diseases. And one of those diseases they get is a fungal infection by a fungus called Massospora cicadina where a third of the body has been replaced with fungal tissue. This causes something called active host transmission causing erratic mating behavior spreading the disease (basically making other Cicada "Zombies").  Also, a possible factor is the impact of climate change since broods emerge at specific soil temperatures and this year is predicted to be the hottest year on record. In this project we identify if a cicada has the cicadina fungus or not based on image data. We use the following image recognition models: VGG16, VGG19 and InceptionV2 to tackle our problem. Our project was originally inspired by [1].

## Key Stakeholders

- **Entomologists:** The phenomenon offers scientists a unique opportunity to delve deeper into the intricate world of these enigmatic vocalists. So, experts are leaping at the chance to further unravel the mysteries of cicada biogeography, evolutionary adaptations, and the ecological significance of their cyclical emergence,
- **Pharmaceutical research scientists:** Understanding the phenomenon can have potential impact on medical research on fungal diseases in general (possibly in other animals),
- **Climate researchers** A deeper understanding of the phenomenon could potentially help researchers understand the climate change better,
- **Cicada enthusiasts:** Searching for and finding cicadas is a fun and family-friendly activity.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset:** The project uses images of healthy and infected cicadas from the website iNaturalist (see [2]). We used three different data sets and ran the three models VGG16, VGG19 and InceptionV2 on each of the three data sets. Here are the references to our three data sets together with the percentage split between the number of healthy vs infected cicadas: [10] (47% healthy, 53% infected), [11] (68% healthy, 32% infected), [12] (65% healthy, 35% infected).

We had to clean up our data sets by removing images with multiple cicadas or no cicadas. We stratified the data set into a 20% Test, 10% Validation and 70% Train.   

- **Models:** Popular convolutional neural network architectures such as VGG16, VGG19 and InceptionV2 are used dataset for image classification (see [8]).

## Neural Network Models

### Terminology

The necessary terminology for this project comes from neural networks and biology. We refer the reader to [9]. 

### Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition (VGG):

#### VGG16

The VGG-16 is one of the most popular pre-trained models for image classification and it has 16 Convolutional Layers. Here is the architecture of VGG-16:

![vgg16-neural-network](https://github.com/DigDugData/Cicada-Zombies/assets/122245444/18756380-95db-41e0-8f45-7a01e0233132)

#### VGG19

VGG-19, also known as VGGNet-19, is a 19-layer convolutional neural network (CNN). It has the same basic structure as the VGG16 model, but with three additional convolutional layers. Architecture: The 16 convolutional layers are grouped into five blocks, with a MaxPooling layer after each block. The MaxPooling layer reduces the image size by half and doubles the number of convolution layer filters. The final three dense layers in block 6 have dimensions of 4096, 4096, and 1000, respectively. Here's the architecture of VGG19:

### InceptionV2

The inception module performs convolutions with different filter sizes on the input, performs max pooling, and concatenates the result for the next Inception module. The number of layers is 42, compared to VGG16â€™s paltry 16 layers.

We refer the reader to [8] for more detailed descriptions of these models. 

## Model performance comparision on all three data sets

See [13] for webscraping code to obtain the images of healthy and infected cicadas. We refer the reader to [14] for the model comparison. 

## Possible Future Work 

- Improve the model performance further by either increasing the size of the data set or use augmentation of only the class of infected cicadas,
- Use random cropping to ensure that cicadas appearing on the images are correctly positioned,
- After the training, classify on which kind of images the models perform better,
- Determine how bioclimatic variables influence infection rates in cicadas,
- Examine how climate change and warmer soil temperatures impact the timing of emergence of cicadas,
- Development of a final product possibly a mobile app.
