# Cicada-Zombies

This spring, two broods of periodical cicadas (among seven) will emerge in parts of the South and the Midwest singing their love songs. The co-emergence of these two broods has not happened since Thomas Jefferson was president. Like many animals, they, too, are susceptible to diseases. And one of those diseases they get is a fungal infection by a fungus called Massospora cicadina where a third of the body has been replaced with fungal tissue. This causes something called active host transmission causing erratic mating behavior spreading the disease (basically making other Cicada "Zombies").  Also, a possible factor is the impact of climate change since broods emerge at specific soil temperatures and this year is predicted to be the hottest year on record.
