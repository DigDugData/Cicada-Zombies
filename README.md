# Cicada-Zombies

This spring, two broods of periodical cicadas (among seven) will emerge in parts of the South and the Midwest singing their love songs. The co-emergence of these two broods has not happened since Thomas Jefferson was president. Like many animals, they, too, are susceptible to diseases. And one of those diseases they get is a fungal infection by a fungus called Massospora cicadina where a third of the body has been replaced with fungal tissue. This causes something called active host transmission causing erratic mating behavior spreading the disease (basically making other Cicada "Zombies").  Also, a possible factor is the impact of climate change since broods emerge at specific soil temperatures and this year is predicted to be the hottest year on record. One of the questions we address in this project is whether we can accurately identify if a Cicada has the Massospora cicadina fungus or not based on image data.
