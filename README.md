# Cicada Zombies: classification of cicadas affected with Massospora cicadina fungus using image data

This spring, two broods of periodical cicadas (among seven) will emerge in parts of the South and the Midwest singing their love songs. The co-emergence of these two broods has not happened since Thomas Jefferson was president. Like many animals, they, too, are susceptible to diseases. And one of those diseases they get is a fungal infection by a fungus called Massospora cicadina where a third of the body has been replaced with fungal tissue. This causes something called active host transmission causing erratic mating behavior spreading the disease (basically making other Cicada "Zombies").  Also, a possible factor is the impact of climate change since broods emerge at specific soil temperatures and this year is predicted to be the hottest year on record. In this project we identify if a cicada has the cicadina fungus or not based on image data. We use several image recognition models such as VGG15. VGG19, ResNet and Inception.

## Key Stakeholders

- **Entomologists:** The phenomenon offers scientists a unique opportunity to delve deeper into the intricate world of these enigmatic vocalists. So, experts are leaping at the chance to further unravel the mysteries of cicada biogeography, evolutionary adaptations, and the ecological significance of their cyclical emergence.
- **Pharmaceutical research scientists:** Understanding the phenomenon can have potential impact on medical research on fungal diseases in humans.
- **Cicada enthusiasts:** Searching for and finding cicadas is a fun and family-friendly activity

## Project Overview

- **Dataset:** The project uses images of healthy and infected cicadas from various websites such as National Library of Medicine,- GenBank, iNaturalist.
- **Extensive Data Exploration:**
- **Models:** Popular convolutional neural network architectures such as ResNet, VGG16, VGG19 and Inception are used dataset for image classification.
